<p class="font-medium">Call for Submissions</p>

We call for submissions of original productions in two separate routes:
<ol>
  <li>Scientific Papers: We welcome scientific papers that address topics related to quantum computing and musical creativity. We plan to publish a conference proceedings with accepted papers (more information soon). Your paper, if accepted, will be presented in an oral format during the conference. Short musical demonstrations can be part of the presentation, in case that contributes to the exposition of your scientific research outcomes.<br><br>

  We welcome papers analysing/reporting on scientific, technical, artistic and/or practice-based developments in <strong>Quantum Computer Music</strong>. Topics may include, but are not limited to:

  <ul>
    <li>Quantum Algorithms in Music</li>
    <li>Quantum-computing Aided Composition</li>
    <li>Quantum Representations of Audio</li>
    <li>Quantum Signal Processing</li>
    <li>Musical Instruments</li>
    <li>Quantum Computing Software for Music</li>
    <li>Sonification of Quantum Processes and Phenomena</li>
    <li>Live performance with Quantum Computing</li>
    <li>Music Information Retrieval</li>
    <li>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architectures</li>
    <li>Music Theory and Quantum Computing Intersections</li>
    <li>Quantum Aesthetics</li>
    <li>Brain Quantum Computer Interfaces</li>
    <li>Quantum Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Quantum Natural Language Processing</li>
    <li>Music Industry Applications</li>
    <li>Quantum Computational Musicology</li>
    <li>Quantum Computer Music in Education</li>
  </ul>
      </li>
 
      <br>
      All paper submissions will be peer-reviewed (double blind) for originality, academic standards, appropriateness of topic, readability (language), and organisation.<br><br>

      <li>Musical Works: We also welcome short musical compositions (fixed-media) and/or performances and/or demonstrations that showcase the intersection of quantum computing and musical creativity. For this route, a detailed <strong>manuscript</strong> explaining the idea must be submitted. 

        <br><br>Please follow the instructions under the <strong>Manuscript Instructions</strong> section below in this page, for the expected format and content of the manuscript.

        If the work is accepted, it will be diffused/performed during the conference, at our conference auditorium - <a href='https://www.unipa.it/servizi/cerimoniale/concessione-spazi-steri/Spazi_Steri/'><u>Sala Delle Capriate</u></a><br><br>

     All manuscripts will be reviewed for originality, academic standards, appropriateness of topic, readability (language), and technical feasibility. The audio/video file will be assessed for its artistic/conceptual quality and relevance to the manuscript and the topic.<br><br> 
     Please note that currently, we are able to provide only minimal technical equipment for the live performances. We will provide a stereo sound system, a projector, and potentially internet connection. Special situations can be discussed, but you should consider bringing your own equipment and musical instruments, whenever applicable. Please make sure to include this information in your tech rider.<br><br>

</ol>


<p class='font-medium' id="papers">Paper Submission</p>
<!-- #E40066 color for when submissions are closed. -->
<p>The paper submission for ISQCMC '25 is currently <u><a id="paper-submission"><span style='color: #E40066;'>closed</span></a></u>. Please refer to the detailed instructions below to ensure a smooth peer-review and avoid unnecessary rejections of your submission.</p>


The deadline for submission is <span style='text-decoration: line-through; color: #6c6c6c'>May 09, 2025</span> <strong><span style= 'text-decoration: line-through;'>May 18, 2025 - 23:59 CEST</span></strong>. <br>

<p>Paper Submission Instructions</p>
Please make sure the paper is formatted according to the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/isqcmc-2025-template/qyfngrjtyvjv"><u>ISQCMC 2025 Template</u></a>, is <em> anonymized</em> (see the Anonymization section below),and does not exceed 5 pages.<br><br>

All submissions are to be sent to <a id="paper-2submission">quantummusicsubmission AT gmail DOT com</a>, and <strong> should contain the following information and files:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Full names of all authors, and their respective affiliations (if applicable)</li>
  <li>Clear indication of the corresponding author(s) and their contact email(s)</li>
  <li>The <em>anonymized version</em> of your paper, in PDF format</li>
  <li>Any additional supporting information or appendices</li>
</ul>
  



<p> Anonymization </p>
Your paper should be anonymized for the double-blind peer-review process. This means that you should hide or censor any information that could identify the authors, such as names, affiliations, or acknowledgments. Any other information that may reveal your identity should be ideally avoided. In case you are using a substantial amount of self-referential citations, you may also consider censoring them while adjusting the writing to imply so (e.g. "In our previous work [censored citation]"). <br>

<p><em>LaTeX Template Anonymization usage:</em></p> The <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/isqcmc-2025-template/qyfngrjtyvjv"><u>ISQCMC 2025 LaTeX Template</u></a> has a feature that submitters can use to anonymize their papers. Its usage is explained below. <br><br>

Check <strong>line 20</strong> of the template for the line reading <tt>\usepackage[blind]{anonymize}</tt><br>

This is the command that imports the anonymization functionality, and allows the submitter to censor content by wrapping the text around the <tt>\anonymize{ANY CONTINUOUS TEXT HERE}</tt> environment. Notice that in the template, parts of the abstract and the sponsorship footnote were written this way.

<br><br><strong> Switch the anonymization on/off:</strong> While writing the paper, you can switch the anonymization off by removing the <tt>[blind]</tt> argument from the import command: <tt>\usepackage{anonymize}</tt>.

<br><br> In case there are any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to the organizers through our <a id="general-enquiry"><u>email</u></a> (quantummusicsubmission AT gmail DOT com)
